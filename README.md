# calc

A simple calculator for adding numbers repeatedly. The GUI is built with Tkinter and provides an entry box for numbers, an **Add** button and a **Clear** button. The list of numbers and the running total are displayed on screen.

Run the program with:

```bash
python3 calc.py
```

Press `Enter` or click **Add** to add the value from the entry box. Use **Clear** to reset the calculation.
